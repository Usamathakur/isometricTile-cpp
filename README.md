# isometricTile-cpp-small-project

## This is a small project on the Isometric Tiles how they behave in the graphics of our screen. These tiles are in daimond shape but while traversing through x and y axis as nothing is 3D. How we can create a plane where we can place our sprites.

This project was important for my personal research as I learnt that my research of (Usama's Grid System) has some properties of graphics on screen every project I learn and do makes me a better programmer.

Thank You!
